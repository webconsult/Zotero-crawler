<th>Abstract</th>
<td>This research examines the role of the corporate-centre in the formulation and implementation of an information systems strategy. The approach is inspired by recognition of an established parallel model, available for role prediction in general corporate management. Existing IS strategy models are evaluated for applicability against the role-prediction criterion but found to be inexplicit in this respect. A number of potential roles, for the IS centre, are therefore defined and evaluated in the light of literature sources and field research undertaken through interviews with senior IS managers in a small group of technologically oriented organisations. By this process the framework for a predictive model, suitable for discussion and analysis of IS roles at executive level, is derived and critically evaluated.</td>

<p>Use of EoS:</p>
<p>It is argued that IS centralization is often seen as providing economy-of-scale benefits in both hardware and personnel, promoting the development of common systems and adding value by achieving synergies of integration. Conversely, it is argued that decentralization and end-user orientation, allows IS to meet different business unit needs and gives a much closer, more responsive and accountable, customer focus to IS development. After all, the end-user should understand the business issues better than the IS professional and is thereby better positioned to find new, innovative ways of exploiting IT.<br /><br />Since advantages and disadvantages may be attributed to both approaches it appears likely that most organisations might select a balanced approach in which some roles are enacted centrally while others are devolved locally. For example, where economies of scale are available, a tight and/or a unified view is necessary, and when business responsiveness is non-problematic, a substantial degree of centralization may be appropriate. However, where speed, flexibility and uniqueness of service are high priorities and where resource costs are low and usage high, devolved IS is usually considered more appropriate.<br /><br />Centralization of the core development resource can provide economies of scale where the nature of the business permits such commonality. <br /><br />Standards enforcement is readily facilitated if hardware and software must be purchased through an agency that will only specify to the approved standards. Moreover, central purchasing puts the business in a much stronger position when negotiating with suppliers, thereby harnessing significant economies of scale associated with bulk purchasing of hardware and software.<br /><br />Since business units now enjoy a greater degree of autonomy in managing their own strategies a large, centralized support and development IS function is usually inappropriate. Conversely, leaving IS strategy decisions completely to the business units also appears inappropriate since the low level of business diversification suggests that economies of scale, achievable through the use of common systems, may be missed.</p>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>Over the last twenty years, the computer industry has become global with respect to computer production as well as computer use, a trend which has raised concerns among U.S. policymakers of hollowing out the industry and exporting employment. This paper uses the framework of increasing returns to analyze the issue. It classifies market segments within the computer industry, shows how the advent of the personal computer created these segments, examines how this change in the structure of the industry led to the evolution of an Asia-Pacific production network, identifies company and country leadership in this network, and evaluates the implications for the United States. It shows that some manufacturing employment, mainly in the decreasing returns segments of the industry, has shifted to the Asia- Pacific region. However, it also shows that employment in some manufacturing segments and in software and services, which are increasing returns or hybrid markets, has increased dramatically in the United States. It concludes that the global division of labor between the United States and both companies and countries in the Asia-Pacific region has been largely positive in that it has supported the continuing U.S. leadership position in the global computer industry.(Increasing and Decreasing Returns; Globalization; Computer Industry; Industrial Policy; Industry Structure; Competition; Asia-Pacific Region)</td>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>As  demand for online network services continues to grow, service providers are looking to meet this need and avail themselves of business opportunities. However, despite strong growth in demand,providers continue to have dif .culty achieving profitability, customer churn remains high,and network performance continues to draw complaints.  We suggest that strategicbusiness planning for network services would benefit from a systems thinking approach that analyzes the feedback effects present in the underlying business process.  These feedback loops can be complex and have significant impact n business performance.  For  instance, while the size of a providers customer base depends on price and network performance, network performance is itself dependent on the size of the customer base.  In this paper,  we develop a planning model that represents these feedback effects using the finite difference  equations methodology of systems dynamics.The model is validated by showing its fit with essential characteristics of the underlying problem domain,and by showing its ability to rep-  licate observed reference mode behaviors.Simulations are then carried out under a variety of  scenarios to examine issues important to service providers.Among other findings,the simulations suggest that (a) under flat-rate pricing, lowering price to increase customer base can  hurt profitability as well as network performance; (b) under usage-based pricing, lowering price need not necessarily lead to a larger customer base; and (c) in addition to price, the customers of  threshold of tolerance for performance degradation plays a significant role in balancing market  share with profitability.  We briefly present a prototype decision support system based on the  systems thinking approach, and suggest ways in which it could be used to help business  planning for network services.</td>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>At the dawn of the Information Age, the competitive dynamics in numerous industries are more intense than ever before. We look at the implications of competitive dynamics to IT strategies. We summarize the basic logic of various well-known (IT) strategy methods, particularly regarding sustainability of an advantage and conclude that (IT) strategy theory incorporates precious little about competitive dynamics. We then explore a recent strategy framework, Sustainability Analysis [Calif. Mgmt Rev. 34 (1992) 29; Strategy and the Search for Rents: The Evolution of Diversity among Firms, 1994; Renewable Advantage, 1998]. Sustainability Analysis distinguishes three ‘ecologies’ that entail important differences in strategies and timelines for sustaining (IT) advantage. We review these ecologies and draw insights for IT strategy.</td>

<p>Use of EoS:<br /><br />standard cycle products are high-volume, low-margin, with product advantages lasting 4±6 years. Williams points out that standard-cycle organizations must standardize their products and resources to exploit economies of scale. Over time, the firms typically become large and complex. To counteract the resulting diseconomies of scale, a key management skill is `orchestration,' the coordination and optimization of numerous activities in the organization.<br /><br />An example of a long/standard hybrid is Amazon.com. Amazon.com is a (self-)service organization that, in the words of Jeff Bezos (CEO), is designed for ahelping people make purchase decisionso. It sells standard products through standardized processes, and has a large, and increasing, scale of distribution operations to reap economies of scale, all pointing to standard cycle. Over time, Amazon can expect to derive substantial bargaining power (over suppliers) from its size. In addition, Amazon.com is attempting a long-cycle strategy: Lock in customers by exploiting increasing return effects from collaborative filtering. By offering customers superior suggestions (based on the interests and purchasing history of the customer and of other customers), it entices customers to purchase more, enabling Amazon to offer even better suggestions.</p>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>Here we investigate the relationship between the use of geographic and information technology (IT) scope as complementary factors to affect the value of products, the cost of operations and the overall performance of firms. We introduce the IT/Geographic Scope Matrix (IGSM) as a framework with which to study and understand the relationship in order to better manage the firm. We develop expectations that the consistent use of either high or low levels of IT and geographic scope may result in better firm performance than inconsistent use, where high levels of one are matched with low levels of the other. We apply the IGSM in a study of eleven firms, all of which provide financial services, specifically international cash management and trade finance, to firms in Hong Kong. The results of our study suggest that the IGSM may be a useful tool for IS planning and research and have implications for the co-ordination of business and IT planning.</td>

<p>Use of EoS:<br /><br />Why is geographic scope important to the firm? Several factors push firms toward global scope. Some of these factors include economies of scale, competitive advantage to integration, learning curves, location advantages, and integration advantages. Econo- mies of scale favour globalization (Porter, 1986). Innovations that increase the portion of product costs that are fixed across many customers lead to high economies of scale (Ghemawat and Spence, 1986)<br /><br />Economies of scale. The extent to which marginal costs for the next unit of product are lower than average costs. Producing and delivering products using IS results in higher economies of scale as firms use IS to replicate products for many customers at low marginal cost (Bakos, 1991). This effect results in firms with high levels of IT scope having lower marginal costs. This suggests that the lowest cost firms should be large firms with high IT scope, followed by small firms with low IT scope. Firms with high IT scope and small size or large size and low IT scope should tend to have higher costs.<br /><br />Global high-tech. Firms in this region may generally be expected to have the highest revenue because of customer value as well as high expenses because of high IT and geographic scope. Eventually, the firm may learn to achieve reduced expenses because IT investments increase economies of geographic scope and scale. Firms in this cell are expected to have the highest and increasing margins.<br /><br />The global high-tech banks have, on average, the highest staff and overall operating expenses. This is inline with our expectations about the costs of geographic scope and IT scope. That their premises expenses are not the highest suggests that they have achieved some savings from increased economies of scale and scope from their IT investments.<br /><br />Managers might beneit from future research that looked at related issues, such as the complementarity of product scope and IT or scale and IT. Future studies could also examine the issue of IT and geographic scope using field experiments with measures and data suited to statistical hypothesis testing.</p>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>Digital products are now widely traded over the Internet. Many researchers have started to investigate the optimal competitive strategies and market environments for such products. This paper studies the competitive decisions made about software, a major class of digital products that can be easily sold through computer networks. Instead of focusing on traditional competitive dimensions, such as price or quantity, we study the number of functions that should be incorporated into the software. Using game theoretic analysis, we show that there is no fixed strategy that is optimal for software developers in a duopoly market with one-stage simultaneous moves. This happens because, given one developer&apos;s decision, there is always an incentive for the other developer to deviate and achieve higher payoffs. Nevertheless, a unique reactive equilibrium does emerge if we consider the two-stage variation of the model, where the two developers both enjoy substantial profits by serving different segments of the market. Essentially, the first mover commits himself to a certain functionality level that induces a rational follower to target his software to the (previously) unattended segment. We discuss our results in light of scale economies in the software development process and market segmentation.</td>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>Abstract. In recent years, an increasing amount of attention has been paid to information systems (IS) outsourcing by practitioners as well as academics. However, our understanding of the factors that affect outsourcing success is hardly complete. By adopting transaction cost theory (TCT) as the theoretical foundation, this study analyses the implications of transaction attributes on the consequences of customized software outsourcing practice. The research model includes three exogenous variables (contractor reputation, asset specificity and uncertainty) and two endogenous variables (post-contractual opportunism and outsourcing success). The moderating effects of asset specificity on the relationships between uncertainty and the endogenous variables are also examined. Based on data collected in Taiwan, a research model is constructed to test the hypotheses derived from the theory. The empirical evidence is generally supportive of the theory but with some important exceptions. In particular, contractor reputation and uncertainty have the predicted effects on the contractor’s post-contractual opportunism perceived by the client and outsourcing success, but asset specificity shows a negative effect on post-contractual opportunism and a positive effect on outsourcing success, which are opposite to the typical predictions of TCT. Thus, in addition to the supportive findings of the theory, this study also raises an important research question regarding the effects of asset specificity on outsourcing for future research to explore.</td>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>To date, most research on information technology (IT) outsourcing concludes that firms decide to outsource IT services because they believe that outside vendors possess production cost advantages. Yet it is not clear whether vendors can provide production cost advantages, particularly to large firms who may be able to replicate vendors&apos; production cost advantages in-house. Mixed outsourcing success in the past decade calls for a closer examination of the IT outsourcing vendor&apos;s value proposition. While the client&apos;s sourcing decisions and the client-vendor relationship have been examined in IT outsourcing literature, the vendor&apos;s perspective has hardly been explored. In this paper, we conduct a close examination of vendor strategy and practices in one long-term successful applications management outsourcing engagement. Our analysis indicates that the vendor&apos;s efficiency was based on the economic benefits derived from the ability to develop a complementary set of core competencies. This ability, in turn, was based on the centralization of decision rights from a variety and multitude of IT projects controlled by the vendor. The vendor was enticed to share the value with the client through formal and informal relationship management structures. We use the economic concept of complementarity in organizational design, along with prior findings from studies of client-vendor relationships, to explain the IT vendors&apos; value proposition. We further explain how vendors can offer benefits that cannot be readily replicated internally by client firms.</td>

<p>Use of EoS:</p>
<p>economies of scale and scope argu- ment would predict that outsourcing has little to offer larger firms, because they can generate economies of scale and scope internally by repro- ducing the production methods used by vendors. The data on outsourcing, however, indicates that many large firms continue to pursue outsourcing arrangements</p>
<p>firms outsource IT to attain cost advantages from assumed economies of scale and scope possessed by vendors</p>
<p>Conceptsthatappearedinthecausalmapwereconsolidated: vendorneeded scale and scope to reduce the costs of developing competencies, and com- petencies were used to reduce the cost of delivery on each project.</p>
<p>The theory was used to reinterpret the theme as saying that the scale and scope in IS services was used to develop an experience-based set of practices that increase vendor's productivity and profitability. This doesn't answer the main research question completely, as it is not clear that a large client couldn't develop these practices in-house.</p>
<p>Consistent with neoclassical economics, owner- ship of a large number of projects provided ABC with economies of scale in IT services provi- sioning. Its scale justified its upfront investment in competencies</p>
<p>ABC's access to, and control over, a large number and variety of IT projects provided economies of both scale and scope.</p>
<p>in application management, vendors use economies of scale and scope to combat specific labor market and business condi- tions by developing complementary practices.</p>
<p>One can also test this in different domains of outsourcing, controlling for firm size (economies of scale) and experience- based learning factors.</p>
<p>It says that firms build their skills from experiential learning, (i.e.. doing something repeatedly) as in economies of scale and scope: firms build capabilities through exper- ience.</p>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>Many of the pure internet-based businesses that proliferated over the past 5 years have encountered serious problems as their lofty valuations have plunged. Industry observers have attributed this phenomenon to a variety of factors, generally framed in terms of poor conceptualization or implementation of the ‘business model’. This study explores an often-used concept in strategic management called ‘strategic orientation’ and applies it to internet-based businesses. Based on an analysis of over 100 public businesses, firms that cluster together with similar strategic orientation are observed. These strategic groups are then analysed for performance differences. The results are discussed with the intent of learning from the dot-burn effects as we evolve to the next generation of internet-based business.</td>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>The research reported in this paper identifies those factors that, taken together with Information Systems (IS) augmentations, affect the competitive positioning of businesses. The research focuses on the financial services, retailing and manufacturing sectors, spanning the levels of business information intensity found in the UK. The paper is in two parts. The first deals with the scope and duration of the achievement of IS-enabled enhanced competitive positioning. Around 25% of businesses in the sample were judged to have at least one IS that allowed the organisation to gain competitive advantage, whilst 30% were judged to have at least one IS that nullified a competitor&apos;s advantage. Broadly, all sectors showed the same pattern. The median time that a competitive advantage was held was between 6 and 18 months. The second part of the paper is concerned with the establishment of an IS-enabled opportunity framework, identifying the associated business benefits, the associated changes in competitive position, and the sources of sustainable achievement. Twenty-two factors were identified as being significant in turning a business benefit into a competitive advantage, and seven were identified as significant in converting this competitive advantage into a sustainable one. These factors were overwhelmingly within the internal architecture of the organisation. The findings support the view that sustainable IS-enabled competitive advantage is elusive.</td>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>This research provides empirical evidence of the role of information technology (IT) as an enabler of growth in firms. We postulate that as a firm grows larger, a superior IT infrastructure increases the productivity of other inputs by controlling the complexity-related costs that the firm incurs as it increases in size. In the empirical analysis to support this view, we find that firms with high-growth expectations increase their IT spending as their free cash flow increases, whereas low-growth firms maintain a constant level of IT spending, irrespective of their free cash flow. Further, we analyze the effect of IT investments in one period on growth-related metrics in subsequent periods. We find that a superior IT infrastructure significantly reduces the cost of operations for high-growth firms in subsequent periods. In summary, the theory and empirical evidence presented in this paper point to an indirect but important contribution of the IT infrastructure to a firm&apos;s growth.</td>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>IS research has considered the outsourcing decision from the perspective of transaction cost economics (TCE) and institutional theory. In this research, we consider how the appropriation of the logic of transaction cost economics is contingent on decision makers&apos; institutional context. The institutional contexts contrasted are professional versus political contexts. In a survey of 214 city governments in the United States, we substantiate the existence of these two institutional contexts, a distinction that has been noted to extend into the private sector as well. Subsequent analyses of the moderating effects of institutional context on the application of the TCE heuristic to the outsourcing decision revealed the following: The institutional context moderated the impacts of &quot;human frailty&quot; conditions--of opportunism and bounded rationality--and of transaction frequency on outsourcing decisions. In professional contexts, opportunism reduced outsourcing and frequency increased outsourcing; in political contexts, bounded rationality fostered outsourcing and frequency dissuaded outsourcing. However, no institutional moderation was noted for the situational conditions of asset specificity and uncertainty. Instead, situational conditions were found to increase the incidence of outsourcing across both contexts. Findings about the contingent effects of human frailty conditions augment our understanding of the outsourcing phenomenon by emphasizing that decision makers&apos; attentiveness to the logic of transaction costs during outsourcing is shaped by their institutional context. Findings with regard to situational conditions suggest a need for future research to consider the role of another contextual factor--resource munificence--in mitigating the effects of situational conditions on responses to transaction costs.</td>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>Although increasing evidence suggests that superior performance requires alignment between firms&apos; strategies and production processes, it is not known if such alignment is relevant for software development processes. This study breaks new ground by examining how firms align their software processes, products, and strategies in Internet application development. Drawing upon the literatures in strategy, operations management, and information systems, we identify four dimensions that influence alignment: the business unit strategy, the level of product customization, the level of process customization, and the volume of customers. To examine how these dimensions are synchronized, we conducted detailed case studies of Internet application development in nine varied firms including both start-ups and established &quot;brick and mortar&quot; companies. Our analyses reveal that the firms in our study do use differing processes for Internet application development, and that many of the firms match their software process choices to product characteristics, customer volume, and business unit strategies. We develop concept maps for the firms that are in alignment to illustrate how managers configure specific product and process dimensions. We also offer potential explanations for why some firms are misaligned, such as attempting to execute incompatible strategies, the lack of coordination between marketing and production strategies, the too rapid expansion of process scope, and inflexible barriers to rapid adaptation of process. Our study contributes detailed insights into how software processes and customized to complement different types of product requirements and strategies.</td>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>As outsourcing evolves into a competitive necessity, managers must increasingly contend with the decision about which software development projects to outsource. Although a variety of theories have been invoked to study the initial outsourcing decision, much of this work has relied in isolation on one theoretical perspective. Therefore, the relative importance ascribed by managers to the factors from these theories is poorly understood. The majority of this work also masks interesting insights into outsourcing decisions by focusing on the information technology (IT) function rather than individual projects as the unit of analysis, where many of these decisions occur. In contrast, prior research at the project level has focused on predicting development performance in the postoutsourcing-decision phases of projects. The objective of this study is to examine the relative importance that IT managers ascribe to various factors from three complementary theories--transaction cost economics, agency theory, and knowledge-based theory--as they simultaneously consider them in their project outsourcing decisions. A secondary objective is to assess the cross-cultural robustness (United States versus Japan in this study) of such models in predicting project-level IT outsourcing decisions. We develop and test a multitheoretic model using data on 1,008 project-level decisions collected from 33 Japanese and 55 U.S. managers. Overall, our results provide novel insights into the relative importance that managers ascribe to the factors from these three theories, their complementarities and occasional contradictions, and offer new insights into the differences among U.S. and Japanese IT managers. Implications for theory and practice are also discussed.</td>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>Virtual communities are a significant source of information for consumers and businesses. This research examines how users value virtual communities and how virtual communities differ in their value propositions. In particular, this research examines the nature of trade-offs between information quantity and quality, and explores the sources of positive and negative externalities in virtual communities. The analyses are based on more than 500,000 postings collected from three large virtual investing-related communities (VICs) for 14 different stocks over a period of four years. The findings suggest that the VICs engage in differentiated competition as they face trade-offs between information quantity and quality. This differentiation among VICs, in turn, attracts users with different characteristics. We find both positive and negative externalities at work in virtual communities. We propose and validate that the key factor that determines the direction of network externalities is posting quality. The contributions of the study include the extension of our understanding of the virtual community evaluation by users, the exposition of competition between virtual communities, the role of network externalities in virtual communities, and the development of an algorithmic methodology to evaluate the quality (noise or signal) of textual data. The insights from the study provide useful guidance for design and management of VICs.</td>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>This paper focuses on IS integration decisions made during mergers and acquisitions from a strategic-alignment lens. The objectives of this study are to: (1) examine business-IS alignment as reflected in IS integration decisions in a merger context and (2) identify factors that shape IS integration decisions in a merger context. We study these issues in three oil and gas mergers from pre-merger announcement to three to four years after merger announcement. Our contributions are threefold. We show that firms are somewhat misaligned in the early post-merger period, and come into alignment only two to three years after the merger. We find that business-IS alignment was a minor concern for the new organizations in premerger and early post-merger phases. Other factors such as acquirer-target power struggles, prior merger experience, and overarching synergy goals drove much of the initial integration decision making. Only late in the post-merger do the merged organizations revisit their systems to bring them into alignment with the business needs.</td>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>This research examines information systems strategic planning (ISSP) in multinationals from the perspective of the subsidiaries. The research was carried out through interviews with the IT and business managers in subsidiaries of nine large American, European, and Japanese multinationals. The evidence from this study reveals that, in the majority of these organisations, IS planning is either centralised or moving towards centralisation. The main focus of IS planning, in many of these organisations, is to control cost and achieve scale economies. As centralisation increases IT tends to control the planning process and, as a result, IS planning becomes more tactical than strategic and is dominated by IT infrastructure planning. Project implementation was the main criterion used to measure IS planning success. However, due to the dominant role of IT, the subsidiary business managers are often less satisfied with the IS planning approach compared with the subsidiary IT managers. The level of involvement of business managers and their satisfaction with ISSP was related to the degree of decentralisation of responsibility for IS planning.</td>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>In this paper, we present an economic learning model that helps to formalize the complex relationships among an offshoring firm&apos;s knowledge levels, production costs, and coordination costs. Specifically, we model a domestic firm&apos;s use of a selective offshore strategy (i.e., offshoring only a portion of its information technology activities) to exploit, through IT investments or contractual provisions, the foreign vendor&apos;s large, scale-driven repository of production knowledge. We illustrate the conditions under which knowledge transfers during offshoring may reduce a domestic firm&apos;s in-house production costs, leading to total cost savings in both the short term and the long term. Alternatively, when knowledge transfers are not sufficiently large, some short-lived offshoring projects may generate substantial cost savings to the domestic firm; however, long-lived offshoring projects may cause a disruption in the knowledge supply chain, resulting in substantial losses in the later stages of the project. A firm that fails to realize the costs associated with such a disruption soon enough in the project life may find itself locked into a disadvantageous offshoring agreement without any recourse. However, a domestic firm may be able to overcome a disruption in its knowledge supply chain by exploiting the learning-by-doing production knowledge generated by the foreign vendor&apos;s economies of scale. The managerial implications derived from our learning model may help guide firms as they consider the impacts of offshore contracts and knowledge management investments on firm knowledge, production costs, and coordination costs.</td>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>A large body of research has examined the performance effects of diversification. However, these results have been mixed, and scholars have called for examining contingencies under which the effects of different types (related, unrelated, geographic) and levels of diversification on performance vary. This study attempts to fill this gap in the literature by arguing that examining the performance effects of diversification is incomplete without taking into consideration the firm&apos;s information technology (IT) spending. We posit that IT, by enabling coordination and control in firms, is likely to moderate the relationship between diversification and performance. Combining arguments from both resource-based view and the organizational controls literature, we theorize about the moderating effects of IT spending under different types and levels of diversification. Using data from large U.S. manufacturing firms, we test our research hypotheses. Our results indicate that while IT spending interacts with related diversification to have a positive effect on firm performance, similar interactions with unrelated diversification do not have any effects on firm performance. Furthermore, the interaction between IT spending and geographic diversification is positively associated with performance only when the level of geographic diversification is low. We interpret and discuss these results and highlight the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.</td>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>In recent years, flexibility has emerged as a divisive issue in discussions about the appropriate design of processes for making software. Partisans in both research and practice argue for and against plan-based (allegedly inflexible) and agile (allegedly too flexible) approaches. The stakes in this debate are high; questions raised about plan-based approaches undermine longstanding claims that those approaches, when realized, represent maturity of practice. In this commentary, we call for research programs that will move beyond partisan disagreement to a more nuanced discussion, one that takes into account both benefits and costs of flexibility Key to such programs will be the development of a robust contingency framework for deciding when (in what conditions) plan-based and agile methods should be used. We develop a basic contingency framework in this paper, one that models the benefit/cost economics described in narratives about the transition from craft to industrial production of physical products. We use this framework to demonstrate the power of even a simple model to help us accomplish three objectives: (1) to refocus discussions about the appropriate design of software development processes, concentrating on when to use particular approaches and how they might be usefully combined; (2) to suggest and guide a trajectory of research that can support and enrich this discussion; and (3) to suggest a technology-based explanation for the emergence of agile development at this point in history. Although we are not the first to argue in favor of a contingency perspective, we show that there remain many opportunities for information systems (IS) research to have a major impact on practice in this area.</td>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>The sourcing of application development is becoming increasingly complex. While much prior work has investigated sourcing in a homogeneous marketplace, sourcing choices have increased in complexity, with a myriad of choices ranging from insourcing to domestic outsourcing to engaging Application Service Providers (ASP) to offshoring . In this study, based upon four organizational theories (Transaction Cost, Resource-Based View, Resource-Dependence View, and the Knowledge-Based View of the Firm), we suggest 10 attributes that firms consider when deciding upon outsourcing of applications. We tested the attributes&apos; strength by performing conjoint analysis on data collected from 84 IS executives. We constructed profiles, which are combinations of attributes having different levels. Each executive responded to 18 such distinct profiles and selected corresponding outsourcing choices. Our results found that the three most significant drivers of an IT application service choice were cost, risk, and vendor capability. However, the importance of these drivers varied across the different sourcing options. Based upon this, we offer implications for decision-makers and researchers, along with directions for future research.</td>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>Outsourcing of software development allows a business to focus on its core competency and take advantage of vendors&apos; technical expertise, economies of scale and scope, and their ability to smooth labor demand fluctuations across several clients. However, contracting a software project to an outside developer is often quite challenging because of information asymmetry and incentive divergence. A typical software development contract must deal with a variety of interrelated issues such as the quality of the developed system, the timeliness of delivery, the effort and cost associated with the project, the contract payment, and the postdelivery software support. This paper presents a contract-theoretic model that incorporates these factors to analyze how software outsourcing contracts can be designed. We find that despite their relative inefficiency, fixed-price contracts are often appropriate for simple software projects that require short development time. Time-and-materials contracts work well for more complex projects when the auditing process is efficient and effective. We also examine a type of performance-based contract called quality-level agreement and find that the first-best solution can be reached with such a contract. Finally, we consider profit-sharing contracts that are useful in situations where the developer has more bargaining power.</td>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>Despite the extensive research on information technology (IT) outsourcing, our knowledge and understanding of how industry characteristics impact the use of IT outsourcing remain limited. Drawing upon theories from organization behavior and industrial economics, this study identifies four major industry characteristics (i.e., munificence, dynamism, concentration, and capital intensity) and investigates how each of these factors affects the use of IT outsourcing. Specifically, we postulate that the extent of industry munificence is positively related to the utilization of IT outsourcing. Since timely strategic actions are the crucial aspects of leveraging munificent resources, IT outsourcing, which can be implemented in short periods of time, is considered to be a preferred option in such environments. Furthermore, industry dynamism is also positively associated with IT outsourcing, given that firms in dynamically evolving industries tend to look for flexibility and avoid a large amount of fixed investments (e.g., IT development in-house). In contrast to these hypotheses, we predict that industry concentration is negatively related to IT outsourcing. Firms in concentrated industries are likely to develop their own IT infrastructures, as they are not constrained by institutional pressures or cost-driven strategic actions. Finally, because firms in capital-intensive industries tend to conform to long-standing traditional practices, and do not highly value novel and risky practices, they will be less likely to use IT outsourcing than firms in industries with low capital intensity. The data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis along with Compustat empirically validated all of the proposed hypotheses; however, only marginal support was found for the association between industry concentration and IT outsourcing. Our findings offer business executives and IT service providers strategic and managerial insights into the dynamics and complexities involved in the diverse aspects of industry environments and IT outsourcing decisions.</td>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>Today&apos;s software companies face the challenges of highly distributed development projects and constantly changing requirements. This paper proposes the adoption of relevant Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) practices in order to improve software development projects in industry. Many FLOSS projects have proven to be very successful, producing high quality products with steady and frequent releases. This study aims to identify FLOSS practices that can be adapted for the corporate environment. To achieve this goal, a framework to compare FLOSS and industrial development methodologies was created. Three successful FLOSS projects were selected as study targets (the Linux Kernel, the FreeBSD operating system, and the JBoss application server), as well as two projects from Ericsson, a large telecommunications company. Based on an analysis of these projects, FLOSS best practices were tailored to fit industrial development environments. The final results consisted of a set of key adoption opportunities that aimed to improve software quality and overall development productivity by importing best practices from the FLOSS environment. The adoption opportunities were then validated at three large corporations.</td>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>Transaction Cost Theory (TCT) has been widely used in information technology outsourcing (ITO) research to explain and predict outsourcing decisions and outsourcing-related outcomes. This research, however, has led to mixed and unexpected results in terms of the effects of transaction attributes on outsourcing decisions and outcomes. This study assesses the empirical literature employing TCT-based ITO models in terms of its faithfulness to the precepts of TCT, and argues that one possible explanation for the mixed results is that the extant models do not capture all the essential elements of TCT. First, there are core TCT constructs that the extant models do not take into account; second, the linkages among constructs that the IT outsourcing models have hypothesized are not always in line with TCT precepts; and third, the normative nature of the theory is not always captured by the extant models. This paper, therefore, aims to provide one possible answer to the question: “Why have the appropriations made of TCT to study IT outsourcing produced mixed results?”</td>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>In our review, we coded 73 empirical findings from 31 journal articles that applied Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) to study Information Technology Outsourcing (ITO). As Karimi-Alaghehband et al. (2011) note correctly, the empirical results of TCE tests in the context of ITO are mixed. We found that only 49% of the empirical ITO findings supported TCE logic. We found only slightly better support for TCE when it is used as a normative theory (54%) than when it is used as a predictive theory (47%). The main difference between Karimi-Alaghehband et al.’s (2011) contribution and our contribution to the debate focuses upon what to do next. Karimi-Alaghehband et al. (2011) argue that ITO researchers need to apply TCE more faithfully. We argue that we are asking too much of TCE—the ITO phenomenon is more complex than can be accommodated by TCE. We argue that ITO research has matured to the point that we should be building our own endogenous ITO theory. We offer observations and insights on what such a theory might entail. In moving ITO research forward, we first critique TCE assumptions and provide alternative assumptions that seem to fit ITO observations well. We draw on our review of 741 ITO empirical findings (Lacity et al., 2010) to provide a detailed theoretical framework to advance further study that suggests the most promising constructs to use in an endogenous ITO theory.</td>

<th>Abstract</th>
<td>Both theoretical and empirical evidence suggest that, in many markets with standards competition, network effects make the strong grow stronger and can &quot;tip&quot; the market toward a single, winner-take-all standard. We hypothesize, however, that low cost digital conversion technologies, which facilitate easy compatibility across competing standards, may reduce the strength of these network effects. We empirically test our hypotheses in the context of the digital flash memory card market. We first test for the presence of network effects in this market and find that network effects, as measured here, are associated with a significant positive price premium for leading flash memory card formats. We then find that the availability of digital converters reduces the price premium of the leading flash card formats and reduces the overall concentration in the flash memory market. Thus, our results suggest that, in the presence of low cost conversion technologies and digital content, the probability of market dominance can be lessened to the point where multiple, otherwise incompatible, standards are viable. Our conclusion that the presence of converters weakens network effects implies that producers of non-dominant digital goods standards benefit from the provision of conversion technology. Our analysis thus aids managers seeking to understand the impact of converters on market outcomes, and contributes to the existing literature on network effects by providing new insights into how conversion technologies can affect pricing strategies in these increasingly important digital settings.</td>
